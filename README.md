only in which SDE will manage the realtime stock items.

# Daily-Work (5-10-22)

- We have two options:
First:
We can add a custom button in the cmc request form using the form
script. The link which is following is:
https://frappeframework.com/docs/v13/user/en/api/form
Â But here we have an issue of permissions. Because Custom button is
not a field in a doctype and in my knowledge we are only able to gives
permissions to doctype fields to show that fields to some specific
users so here we goes to our Second option

Second:
We can create a field which is of type "Button". I know this is a
silly question but how can we add links behind the Button type fields
in frappe??
I searched this on Google and found that we need to write custom
scripts to make this button working. But I didn't get the correct
syntax for this.

# Daily- Work (6-10-22)

- we checked that if we select items for estimate then it will also reduces in stock.So when our stock becomes completely empty then we need to send
quotations for required items. So now our next task is to send quotations and restore our stock again.
